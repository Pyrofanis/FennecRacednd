    <p>Fennecs are both vulpine and feline humanoids. They have the lush, furry tail of a fox, but it is long like a cat's. They have big ears like a fennec fox, but a shorter muzzle like a cat.They have a relatively similar body to humans, with the same bipedal limb structure. Their most notable feature is a pail of long whiskers dangling from their face. These whiskers end with crystalline deposits from minerals expelled from their body. The older a fennec is, the longer these whiskers. These are perhaps better described as feelers, as these tendril-like whiskers are actually quite muscled and can be manipulated almost like an octopus' tentacles. Their entire body is covered in fur with a wild variety of colors, including blue and yellow.</p>
